## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Khant Min Naing!
### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying at Singapore Management University
I am currently majoring in <strong>Smart-City Management & Technology</strong> where I learn about how cities and people interact through data, technology and management lens. I have taken courses in a range of disciplines including GIS, data analytics, software development, as well as public policy and management. Thanks to the interdisciplinary nature of my coursework, I had the opportunity to work on several research and analytic projects related to smart-city issues and honed my technical and management skills. 

I have been exploring the field of smart-city technology both throughout my time at university and during my summer and winter holidays. I usually read up papers and literatures in urban studies and geoinformatics and write anecdotes on my favourite topics.
